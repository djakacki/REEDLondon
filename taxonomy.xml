           Questions:
           * What are the codes under #572 - English?  Language Type: Indo-European (572)
           We've changed "English" to "Indo-European". I don't know why it's not revised in the eatsml.xml file.  Diane, I don't know which info you are working from or part of the file you are looking at so don't know what you mean by the codes "under" #572.
              
              _Name Parts_
              * Family #560
              * GenName #562
              * Given #564
              * Prefix #566
              * RoleName #18473
              * Suffix #568
              * Title #570
              
              _Name Types_
              * Alias #582
              * Disambiguation #36556  Disambiguation: This name type is used only for working with the  EATS Oxygen plugin and is a (hopefully) temporary fix.  I don't think it's useful if you are not using the EATS Oxygen plugin.
              * Plural #18609
              * Primary #584
              * Singular #18607
              * Variant #586  Variant: We are thinking of deleting (VOIDing) this name type since we are not tracking variant spelling on REED Online. I've not deleted it yet because early on I used it and I have to find places where it's been used and revise the entity pages before I can VOID the name type. Just haven't got around to it yet.
              
              _Scripts_
              * Latin #588
              
              _Dates_
              * Calendar: Julian (#481)
              * Flourished (#494)
              * Lifespan (#486)
              * Circa (#489)
              * Exact (#491)
              
              _Relationship Types_
              * Has occupation (#21008)
              * Is occupation of (reverse)
              * Holds (#45876)
              * Is held by (reverse)
              * Has occupation (#21008)
              * Is occupation of (reverse)
              * Holds (#45876)   Hold/is held by: I think this was another early creation which has been superseded by "Holds office/Office is held by" and "Holds title/Title is held by". We've left it in the list for now but may VOID it later.
              * Is held by (reverse)
              * Holds office (#34962)
              * Office is held by (reverse)
              * Holds title (#494)
              * Title is held by (reverse)
              * Is a member of (#514)
              * Has member (reverse)
              * Is a specific instance of (#19187)
              * Is the general instance for (reverse)
              * Is contained within (#502)
              * Contains (reverse)
              * Is parent of (#505)
              * Is child of (reverse)
              * Is patron of (#12724)
              * Is patronised by (reverse)
              * Is sibling of (#508)
              * Is sibling of (reverse)
              * Is spouse of (#511)
              * Is spouse of (reverse)
              * May be same entity as (#34835) Maybe be same entity as: This relationship is up for DAC discussion. It was originally created for cases where editors say things like "Smith [in the record] may be John Smith, who..." but having it is iffy and some of us are leaning towards deleting this option. Anyway, I'd advise not using it for now? 
              * May be same entity as (reverse)
              
           I am in England and thinking about things.
